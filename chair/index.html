									<h2 class="major">Drawing a seat</h2>
									<p>
										Early 2020, somewhere in February or March. I wanted to draw a chair.. thing.
										I opened GIMP, and drew a chair. Poorly. Very poorly.<br>
										To no surprise, I quickly got bored of staring at a "chair" and decided to add cat ears. Why that specifically? No reason.
										That's when I realized that it looks more like a cat than anything.<br>
										After a few changes, it became an actual cat looking thing; and best of all, it was <i>my creation</i>.

								<div class="content span-3-5">
									<h2 class="major">Rectangular cat looking thing</h2>
									<p>
										The more I looked at what I had created, the more I liked it. So I decided to adapt it as a profile picture,
										and that's when I felt like that image, that rectangular <i>thing</i> could definitely be my icon online.
										So I used it as that, on a lot of places online, never really thinking that I'd need something else. Not for a while, at least.

									<h2 class="major">Chair: Remastered Edition</h2>
									<p>
										Somewhere in early-mid-2020, I cannot exactly remember when (apparently I uploaded it to my personal OneDrive in June 2020),
										I decided "screw it, I might as well try remaking Chair in a 2000px PNG file, that doesn't look like a crappy 500px MS Paint drawing".
										So I did that. And it's now been a year and a half, and I barely used anything else as a profile picture online.<br>
										This image is <strong>mine</strong>, I made it. Why use something else?

									<h2 class="major">The Blinking Thing</h2>
									<p>
										I don't remember specifically what happened here. All I know is that some day I got bored and decided "im gonna animate chair in wick to make him blink".<br>
										So now there's this thing. It blinks. Cool. I like this thing. Sometimes I use it, but sometimes I don't because it makes performance crappy
										and some services just don't handle GIF files really well with profile pictures (example, Mastodon).
