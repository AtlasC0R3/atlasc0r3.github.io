I just now have been made aware that Zorya, "co-owner" of Bus Bunker, has purged every invite that leads to the server. I can see that as nothing else than an act of silencing and aggression, a way to silence the other side of the story and make it so that we can only see *their* side of the argument (which is full of unproven insults against me and my points).

That is fucking petty. I can not see it as any other way than that.

They have not proven to mean this in any other ways, that may explain why they acted so oppressively, or that they mean this with any form of protection. *It's obvious this was made to protect the server from what I can only assume is me (which, again, is symptom of bias and cannot be seen as otherwise, especially after they have done nothing but ditch any and all arguments I have made), but without explaining what menace I may mean. I'd seriously love to hear why they may think I am a threat, other than stubbornness.*

> hi everyone, a bit more of a casual announcement because im not feeling all that well to be frank  
> all invites have been purged and will remain purged for a while, if you want to make one for someone then **please** edit the invite and make it 1 use only, this would make my (and the whole staff team's) job a lot easier and i will be very thankful <3  
> i'll (and other staff members will) most likely go through invites every once in a while and delete any i/we find, im sorry and i hope you all understand

Not sure how preventing invites may help you to "protect" *~~what isn't yours in any way, but we'll get to that~~* the server from a threat that at most is just one bannable user? What were you thinking? **No, really.**  
Besides, if you were actually doing this to protect the server, wouldn't it be the "owner", Zoiudolo, that would announce that? This, to me, just reeks of bias, and I'd love to see reasons as to how that may be proven wrong, *if any*.
