This situation sucks.  
All of this sucks.  
I agree that this is completely uncalled for.  

I agree to be sorry to the community for any disturbances, and whether you agree with me is up to you, I am not here to change your minds *unlike a specific person*. But please make up your mind about me after you've read these documents. This is one of multiple documents explaining my side of the story about all this, and this one will hopefully introduce, in a basic resume, all that has happened in my view.  
The only reason why I wouldn't be sorry is if you're the "owner", of which I am not sorry to you for what I have done, but do agree that some of the directed anger was slightly uncalled for *(then again, my mind varies from "I'm fine with you" to "I hate you" very inconsistently, so I'm still rather unsure of what I think of you)*. Or if you're the "co-owner", in which case I cannot be sorry to you in any way, shape or form. The reason why will be explained further in later documents. *Of course, I don't expect **you** to understand or accept it, knowing you, but hopefully can be understood by others.*  
*And yes, knowing you, this is the only way I can express myself in a way that will be understood, that also won't be silenced by you. If you even care enough to read this.*

## first times
So, somewhere in early-mid 2021 (can't tell between April or May), I left the server and passed ownership to the co-owner at the time, Zoiudolo. I had never intended this to last, as this was one of many times that I simply needed a break as the owner of a (pretty wild, not in a good way) community.  
However, what made that time I did this so important was because he, uh, never really gave ownership back, despite the agreement we had, which was very simple: I take a break, once I'm done, I get ownership back, nothing else brought into the picture.  
Few months, passed, I joined and left, just how Discord goes, until on August 10th. I step up to ask him about getting ownership back. *[Link to message, either for personal reference or for present owner to look at.](https://canary.discord.com/channels/@me/653016104653815819/874807769130221578)*
> hey, mind if i get ownership back in bus bunker?

The reason why I asked "mind if I ..." was because there must have been a reason as to why he did not give me ownership prior, and at the time I had no true reason to be mad at him yet.

Anyway, I'm not here to discuss the specific details about all this. I can send a chat log of my Direct Messages with him, I'm okay with privately distributing chat logs of this conversation if you'd wish to have a look at it.  
He, however, did insist on doing a vote to decide who is owner again, of which I have no idea how this is supposed to solve the agreement we had.  
All I can say is, he was scared because of my impulsivity, and if I'm being honest, kinda felt like I was being brushed off, with no true consistent pattern for me to pinpoint exactly the cause of his worries.  
9 PM, radio silence from him, no news from him. On the 12th, I ask him for news.

so, what did sage say?  
Zoiudolo — 08/12/2021  
ohs hit i forgot to ask her, but she did tell me you asked her for the ownership back

... and that's the last of what I've heard from him about all this. The next DMs date from October 1st, about something **completely** unrelated.  
Safe bet that he's forgot. Or brushed it all off. Not exactly certain, IMO I'm leaning more towards being brushed off, but up to you to decide.

**future note:** [co-owner did bring up that I was the ex-owner](https://discord.com/channels/661616165948489728/661616167378485249/878063372497739786) and that I could get "promoted" (up to what status, no idea), so.. I'm not sure, maybe they tried to say that for the public not to think that they're brushing me off, although that is quite a stretch if I'm being honest. Or maybe, they *did* forget. I'm not sure at all, nothing proves any of these right/wrong, so unfortunately it'll boil down on opinions.

## inbetween
Really, nothing happened inbetween on my end, other than the fact that I had to apply to get a moderator role. *Seriously. The fact that the owner of what used to be his creation had to apply to even have a minimal part in the administration/moderation of his own creation is just.. insane, I think everyone can agree on that.* I do not remember when exactly this happened (somewhere between October and November), and proof resides in a Google Forms document, completely inaccessible by me (presumably owned by zorya/Zoiudolo, so it'd be up to them to ask for details.)

But the problem was, nothing happened on my end. I was never brought into decisions of the server's administration, I had almost completely been forgotten.  
I didn't want to step up to ask again, just yet, because I didn't think it would have made for a good timing. *Looking back, maybe I should've. Nothing was happening, so it's not like much would have been at stake.*

## near past
I'll try listing through specific incidents that I can recall. Because, I can understand that perhaps I was not the most passive about certain things. But something else that *I* understand, that seemingly everyone else doesn't know, or doesn't understand, is all the other circumstances that were happening in my personal life. *I've always liked to have a line between my online self and my real self, which is probably why I have never brought any of this up.*  
All of these events seem to have happened between mid-late March 2022, up to the time of writing all of this (which, right now, is late April). Of course, it's rather difficult to know exactly which events have caused this whole thing, I'd blame the two owners' lack of transparency, but from what I can recall, they were mostly caused by increasing anxiety from school (not exactly exams, but other, too specific things that I'd rather not specify in the public like that), and fucky pill dosage.  
Recently (well, in late March), it had increased, and sometimes I either completely forgot to take them or did not feel like taking them. Which, predictably, led to unstable emotions, probably leading me to being angrier or more impulsive.

One thing I *do* remember however, is the whole April Fools' drama. I've already gone through all of this **numerous** times, but hopefully this may be the last time I'll have to talk about this. *good.*  
That one day, the entire server's feel shifted. The reason why I was so impulsive and mad, was because 1) pills 2) it once was a server that I could be serious in, rely on, hang out with, all of a sudden turned into a massive gimmick and joke. I expressed my anger towards all this in numerous ways, but they have been dismissed. Up to Zoiudolo, or whoever, to explain what happened behind the scenes. Not only that, but two people I was pretty close with (and few others that I'm lesser close with), expressed severe dislike towards this whole event; I tried speaking for them as well, but couldn't do anything because, refer to previous sentence.  
not to mention i was already thinking of this whole ownership thing and i didnt like what was happening in my server, anyway moving on

**future note**:
> also, in my dms, you implied if you had the powers you'd fucking revert the april fools change  
> that is power abuse

please explain how? if i literally feel like my server is being turned into a gimmick, how would reverting all that be power abuse?  
this is another example of lack of transparency. i can only feel like this is made up, and i wish to be proven wrong.


Another thing I remember, GenAi. This is a whole heap of unnecessary drama that could have **easily** been solved by the owners, seeing how obvious our requests were. A lot of people, including me, have expressed that we do not want that bot to really go outside of it's own channel, as it has been for quite some time, but for some reason has been allowed to access every other channel.  
In short, request was: put GenAi back in it's own channel. Rather simple, no? **Well, it took a week to be applied** even after we have clearly said why we do not want it outside of it's own channel, again, like it once was.  
There is literally a rule that means "no bots in #general", and GenAi is allowed to roam around in there, seemingly without consequences. Yet someone constantly using Koya for hugs, or whatever, was given heat. Or using Blargbot one too many times in #general was also giving people heat.  
Not to mention the possibility for the bot to say random nonsense, and be easily flooding #general with such garbled mess, washing away any previous conversation that there would have been. And I know that the bot can't say anything by itself, I'm not an amoeba, but it can still be operated by humans. That means that someone will keep trying their luck, kind of like lottery, until they get something remotely funny. How does this make any logical sense?  
**We do not need to spark this argument again.**


Fast forward, April 16th, [I attempt to remind Zoi](https://discord.com/channels/@me/653016104653815819/965002766449795102) that I still would like to get ownership back.
> So, about that ownership thing, can I have it back? I'm feeling ready to take it back.

One thing I will point out about this whole convo (which, again, I would be more than happy to share with others privately) was that I felt like a lot of Zoi's arguments were kinda shifting around the topics, and implying me to wait again *(which, mind you, I've already done for **8 months**)*, leading to more room for forgetting, like we've seen before.  
I don't want to get into the details of this, really not much happened other than [Zoi claiming the following](https://discord.com/channels/@me/653016104653815819/965031480218763324):
> okay, ill need some extra time to think about all of this at this point

I specified to him "don't take another 9 months", and also brought up the agreement we had. I don't know what he could have thought about *(lack of transparency)*, but I didn't expect it to last longer than, I dunno, 3 days.  
It did.

April 22nd, I ask him if he thought about this whole thing in #general, simply because I was tired of waiting around. Really, I felt like if he would've thought about it, he would've had more than enough time to think about all that could happen; seriously, it's just the ex-owner taking back what was his, after they had agreed to it.

TODO: elaborate on this, right now it is 9:30 and I do not feel like being put through this again.

This all *kinda* ended with zory banning me because I "deleted logs", which, **LMAO**.  
Being fully honest here, yes I did delete messages in #general as a measure of spite using [Discord.py's purge method](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#discord.TextChannel.purge). That perhaps was impulsive. But 1) I had never given it any channel IDs for #logger-channel 2) it wasn't me who kept being brought into more aggressive means now, was it. After being put aside from all decisions about my server's administration, and being thrown off the bus with petty arguments that were not (perhaps never) elaborated, this whole anger was not my doing, it was forced impulsivity caused by others (I wonder who!).  
Anyone with access to Discord's audit logs will realize that I did not delete anything in the logger channel. You're full of yourself, period.

Now, I will say, perhaps doing this in #general was not the best idea. But again, I had no idea how else to be properly noticed and perhaps pressure some sort of action being done. I've already waited enough, and to receive "ill need time to think" again was just too little, so I did escalate it.  
And, if I'm honest, I do feel sorry to most people for starting it there, even partially to the current owner, that could indeed have been handled better.  
Co-owner though, nuh-uh, this is only another one of those incidents that are too numerous for me to forgive like that.  
Was I causing issues? Perhaps, but it's not my fault that I already tried to explain, both in Zoi's DMs and publicly, and instead got my arguments tossed in the air.

Sincere thanks to some specific members though for telling me their thoughts in a way that wasn't "fuck you" (*cough* z).  
I also don't want to blame the current owner too much, I feel we're still friends, but what had happened is too much for me to just forgive like that. Perhaps impulsivity has been a big drawback about this.

## disrespectful aftermath
Sure, some of it was called for, but really it should not have been more than "bye bye discord user". **So why are all invites moderated?**

This feels very, very oppressive. This segment will probably be more specifically about the co-owner's doings, since again, owner doesn't do much to really offend me; main reason why I had a fight with him was because *he* was the owner and I, being the ex-owner, would like to have that back. *Still kinda pissed at you for the fact that you handled the imminent aftermath like a bitch (appending <3 at the end of every message about me, for example) and couldn't even admit in my fucking face that you did not want to follow the agreement, which would have ended a lot of the debate way earlier.*  
No, my distaste, distrust, whatever you wanna call it, is a lot more directed at the co-owner. If I'm being honest, the owner did not do a whole lot in the server, it just kinda felt like the co-owner was taking it to a new direction, of which I can assure you not a whole lot of people would've agreed with, if they weren't faced with extreme pass-aggressive judgment if they even remotely dared to disagree. That's definitely how it felt at times.

Every time I tried having an argumentative talk, it would inevitably escalate by her.  
Every time something felt quite divided, paddy040704 oh-so-magically joined in the discussion to join in on zory's side and kicked my arguments down.  
Every time I tried negotiating a solution, it'd get watered down with severe disagreement.  
Every time someone made even the slightest fuckup, it would be received with extreme, **extreme** judgment.  
Every time it felt like the server was having fun at times, zory would come in and stop it.  
**This does not feel like a small friends server, this feels like North Korea.** And I assure you I am not the only one to feel like this.

A lot of people would've loved to see the server like it was in mid 2020, early 2021. But with zory around, that's just not happening. Not to mention they often acted like my problems never existed and that *they* were the broken one, not me. **Several fucking times.** And none of which ended with someone looking in my fucking eye and saying "ye, i'm sorry, that could have been handled better". They are always in the right. All hail Capital Z zorya. Anyone who disagrees or suggests a solution shall be judged.  
To be honest, do I blame the owner for not doing anything? No, zory's lack of transparency probably led to the owner not knowing how to do anything and just leaving it all to the co-owner, despite all that they're going through.

## verdict
This was pretty brief, I'll probably get into more details about specific things, but I just felt like I had to be honest and show my side of the story, so that it can hopefully be understood, **and not be oppressed, silenced or tossed around by anyone** like it already has been in the past.
