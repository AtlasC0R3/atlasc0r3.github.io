// FOR THE RECORD, this is not actually the lowest member of the Internet's bane.
// A literal crusty shit left in the sun to rot with a dead fly mushed into it.
// A burden to fucking society useful for fuckshit, only to despise everyone and be despised.
// Living, breathing piles of fucking garbage decaying on us humans.
// This script isn't that. Don't worry.

// Note: this script was named "popunder.js", but then uBlock Origin stopped blocking it. Sad.
// So I renamed it to either utep_ad.js or yzfdmoan.js. I picked the former because the latter had a certain word...
