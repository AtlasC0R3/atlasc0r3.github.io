										and enjoys technology as well as music, creativity and gaming.</p>
									<p>
										I often spend most of my time on decentralized social media such as Mastodon, now rarely go on Discord <i>(ew)</i> to
										see if I missed something (often I don't, so Discord sits in no man's land for me),
										listening to rather rock/metal music (or the complete opposite, vaporwave and chiptune. music tastes are weird.), or
								    	just tinkering with Linux computers, server-like Raspberry Pis, or playing games.
									</p>
									<p>
										I hate being mean to people, unless I have my reasons, which usually takes a lot for me to even find any. I mean,
										don't we all have human flaws? <i>I sure do...</i><br>
										I also hate Windows. Just.. No. Ew. NO. Most of the time when I have Windows on a personal computer, it feels like I'm <i>renting</i> my own computer.

									<h2 class="major">Why "atlas core", why "right mouse click"?</h2>
									<p>"atlas core" has a rather simple meaning, referencing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_2">Portal 2</a>'s
										companion robots in the co-op mode. You can either play as <a href="https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Atlas">Atlas</a>
									    or <a href="https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/P-body">P-body</a>. Atlas looks like an <a href="https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Cores">Aperture Science core</a>
									    put into a robotic frame, hence the name "atlas core"; because <strong>Atlas</strong> looks like a <strong>core</strong> put in a robot frame.
									    And P-body looks like a turret in a robotic frame, so it'd be.. I dunno, "p-turret"? <i>Wait, actually no, that sounds like something else.</i><br><i>(can you tell i'm a Valve fan?)</i></p>
										<!-- This is not why I wanted to be part of a robotics concentration at school.
											I might have ideas that seem similar to Michael Reeves', but I'm not making robots on crack yet. -->
									<p>The term "right mouse click" (as in <a href="https://rightmouse.click">rightmouse.click</a>) was just some creative name 
									I tried coming up with when looking at domains and their ends (.com, .co, .me, etc). I didn't want to go with something too basic,
								    so I found "click" and thought of sentences that ended with "click", and thought of "left mouse click", but that was taken.
								    Next logical step; right clicking. That was not taken, and so I went with that one.
									<i>You know, I could probably turn this website into some anti-NFT thing, now that I think about it...</i></p>

								<h2 class="major">Chair</h2>
								<p>This is Chair. Say hi to him.<br>:)</p>
								<p>Long story short, in early 2020, I wanted to draw a chair quickly in GIMP, and decided to add cat ears to it for no reason at all.
									Turns out, it looked a lot more like a cat than a chair, especially with the cat ears. So I decided to go forward with the drawing as a cat.
									And that's how Chair was made.<br>
									Now, this image is actually a revised version of Chair that I made somewhere in mid-2020. <i>Good.</i>

									<h2 class="major">Treasured Memories</h2>
									<p>So, for this part, I wanted to have a random gallery of images I randomly found on my computer of screenshots with little to no context,
										but later on realized that they didn't really fit the "professional"-ish theme, so I decided to make them as another page.
										By that I mean, it's more suggestive than anything here. By that I mean, slight NSFW warning. <i>Most of it is stupid Discord screenshots though, so...</i></p>
