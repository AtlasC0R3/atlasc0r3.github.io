My personal website, based off [HTML5 UP's Ethereal](https://html5up.net/ethereal) and Jekyll pages.

Also used for another drama thing that is really only because, uh, a specific person who I will not name has a Very Oppressive Behavior (or in other terms, George Orwell's 1984) and this is my only way of telling my side of the story in this bullshit; in a way they cannot access.
